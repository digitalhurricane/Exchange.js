Exchange.js
===========

Inspired Foundation's interchange.js (foundation.zurb.com), exchange.js allows you to dynamically load responsive content. Like interchange.js, exchange.js uses media queries to load appropriate content but overcomes several drawbacks, adds more flexibility, optimizes functionality and being written in native javascript, is faster by multiple folds.
